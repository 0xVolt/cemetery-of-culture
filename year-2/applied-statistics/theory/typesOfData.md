# Types of Data

Data is of two broad types, quantitative and qualitative. 

## Qualitative

Qualitative data is represented by relative measures of quality. Eg: students performance in a semester as excellent, good or bad.

## Quantitative

Quantitative data is represented by numeric values or quantities. Eg: number of items, marks obtained in five subjects, etc.

## Types of Quantitative Data

Quantitative data can be split into two parts depending on the type of numbers being dealt with. 
- Numbers belonging to the set of natural nos. are classified into discrete
    - They can be further classified into:
        - Binary (either 1 or 0) 
        - Nominal (its data elements represent the set, eg: Name field is nominal)
        - Ordinal (the nominal data elements have a specific order are termed ordinal)
- Numbers belonging to the set of real nos. are classified into continous
    - They can be further classified into:
        - Interval (if the data falls into a number line)
        - Ratio (Multiple kinds or operations including multiplication and division can be performed on these)
        - The difference between interval and ratio data is that, ratio data has a true zero point. Eg: Temperature, Unemployment rates, percentages, etc. Interval data doesnt have a true zero value and fits on a number line.


## Operations

###### Notice that the next datatype is a subset of the previous one

- Nominal - no operations since they are nominees to the field
- Ordinal - operations of comparison like >, <, ==, etc.
- Interval - ordinal operations + number line operations like +, -
    - <, >, ==, +, -
- Ratio - Interval operations + advanced ops like *, /
    - <, >, ==, +, -, *, /

Question: What kind of statistical operations can be performed on the different quantitative data types?

- Nominal - mode
- Ordinal - mode, median (can be sorted since there is order)
- Interval - mode, mean, median (can be sorted and +, - operations can be performed)
- Ratio - mode, mean, median, etc. (possibly higher since *, / are allowed)

###### Again, notice that the next datatype has properties of the previous one because of the aforementioned hierarchy
