Scala is a general-purpose, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language. It is designed to be concise, expressive, and scalable. Scala is often compared to Java, as both languages are object-oriented and run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). However, there are some key differences between the two languages.

* **Scala is a statically typed language, while Java is a dynamically typed language.** This means that the types of variables and expressions must be known at compile time in Scala, but not in Java.
* **Scala supports higher-order functions, while Java does not.** Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results.
* **Scala supports lazy evaluation, while Java does not.** Lazy evaluation means that expressions are only evaluated when they are needed. This can improve performance in some cases.
* **Scala has a more concise syntax than Java.** This can make Scala code more readable and easier to maintain.

**2. Explain Briefly with example – Scala Array**

An array in Scala is a data structure that can store a fixed number of elements of the same type. Arrays are indexed starting at 0, so the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on.

For example, the following code creates an array of three strings:

```
scala> val myArray = Array("hello", "world", "goodbye")
myArray: Array[java.lang.String] = Array(hello, world, goodbye)
```

The `myArray` variable now contains an array of three strings. We can access the elements of the array using their index. For example, the following code prints the first element of the array:

```
scala> println(myArray(0))
hello
```

**3. Explain Briefly with example – Scala String**

A string in Scala is a sequence of characters. Strings are immutable, which means that they cannot be changed once they are created.

For example, the following code creates a string:

```
scala> val myString = "hello"
myString: java.lang.String = hello
```

The `myString` variable now contains the string "hello". We can access the characters of the string using their index. For example, the following code prints the first character of the string:

```
scala> println(myString(0))
h
```

**4. Explain Briefly with example – Scala Class**

A class in Scala is a blueprint for creating objects. A class defines the properties and methods of an object.

For example, the following code defines a class called `Person`:

```
scala> class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)
defined class Person
```

The `Person` class has two properties: `name` and `age`. The `name` property is a string, and the `age` property is an integer.

We can create an object of the `Person` class using the `new` keyword. For example, the following code creates a `Person` object named `alice`:

```
scala> val alice = new Person("Alice", 25)
alice: Person = Person(Alice,25)
```

The `alice` variable now contains a `Person` object. We can access the properties of the `alice` object using the dot notation. For example, the following code prints the name of the `alice` object:

```
scala> println(alice.name)
Alice
```

**5. Write the difference between Scala Functions & Methods.**

A function in Scala is a block of code that can be passed around as a value. A method is a function that is defined inside a class.

The main difference between functions and methods is that methods can access the properties and methods of the object they are defined on. For example, the following code defines a method called `greet` on the `Person` class:

```
scala> class Person(val name: String, val age: Int) {
         |   def greet = println("Hello, my name is " + name)
         | }
defined class Person
```

The `greet` method can access the `name` property of the `Person` object. For example, the following code calls the `greet` method on the `alice` object:

```
scala> alice.greet
Hello, my name is Alice
```

**6. Scala OOPs Concepts**

* **Scala Object and Classes**

In Scala, an object is a blueprint for creating instances. It defines the properties and methods of an instance. A class is a special kind of object that can be used to create other objects.

For example, the following code defines a class called `Person`:

```
scala> class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)
defined class Person
```

The `Person` class has two properties: `name` and `age`. The `name` property is a string, and the `age` property is an integer.

We can create an object of the `Person` class using the `new` keyword. For example, the following code creates a `Person` object named `alice`:

```
scala> val alice = new Person("Alice", 25)
alice: Person = Person(Alice,25)
```

The `alice` variable now contains a `Person` object. We can access the properties of the `alice` object using the dot notation. For example, the following code prints the name of the `alice` object:

```
scala> println(alice.name)
Alice
```

* **Singleton and Companion Object**

A singleton object is an object that can only have one instance. It is created using the `object` keyword. A companion object is an object that is associated with a class. It is created using the same name as the class, but with the `object` keyword.

For example, the following code defines a singleton object called `Math`:

```
scala> object Math {
         |   def sqrt(x: Double) = Math.sqrt(x)
         | }
defined module Math
```

The `Math` object has a method called `sqrt` that takes a double as input and returns its square root.

The following code defines a class called `Person` and a companion object of the same name:

```
scala> class Person(val name: String, val age: Int) {
         |   def greet = println("Hello, my name is " + name)
         | }
defined class Person

scala> object Person {
         |   def apply(name: String, age: Int) = new Person(name, age)
         | }
defined module Person
```

The `Person` companion object has a method called `apply` that takes a string and an integer as input and returns a new `Person` object.

* **Method overloading and Inheritance**

Method overloading is a feature of Scala that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name, but different parameters. Inheritance is a feature of Scala that allows a class to inherit the properties and methods of another class.

For example, the following code defines a class called `Rectangle`:

```
scala> class Rectangle(val width: Int, val height: Int) {
         |   def area = width * height
         | }
defined class Rectangle
```

The `Rectangle` class has a method called `area` that takes no parameters and returns the area of the rectangle.

The following code defines a class called `Square` that inherits from the `Rectangle` class:

```
scala> class Square(val sideLength: Int) extends Rectangle(sideLength, sideLength) {
         | }
defined class Square
```

The `Square` class inherits the `area` method from the `Rectangle` class.

* **Scala Null Object**

The Scala null object pattern is a design pattern that is used to represent the absence of a value. It is implemented using a special object that has no properties or methods.

For example, the following code defines a null object for the `Person` class:

```
scala> object NullPerson extends Person {
         |   override val name = ""
         |   override val age = 0
         | }
defined module NullPerson
```

The `NullPerson` object is a null object for the `Person` class. It has no name and no age.

* **Traits in Scala**

Traits in Scala are similar to interfaces in other languages. They are a way to define a set of abstract methods that can be implemented by other classes.

For example, the following code defines a trait called `Printable`:

```
scala> trait Printable {
         |   def print(): Unit
         | }
defined trait Printable
```

The `Printable` trait has an abstract method called `print`
