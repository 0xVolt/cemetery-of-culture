    "# Building Language Models in NLP: Creating an auto-Complete model\n",

    "--Types of Language Models--\n",
    "There are two types of language models in NLP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical Models:\n",
    "Statistical models develop probabilistic models that help with predictions for the next word in the sequence. It also uses data to make predictions depending on the words that preceded. Moreover, there are multiple statistical language models that help businesses. For instance, N-Gram, Unigram, Bidirectional, exponential, etc are all examples of statistical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Language Models:\n",
    "Neural Language Models refer to language models that are developed using neural networks. Moreover, the models help mitigate the challenges that occur in classical language models. Further, it helps execute complex tasks like speech recognition or machine transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "A language model in NLP is a probabilistic statistical model that determines the probability of a given sequence of words occurring in a sentence based on the previous words. It helps to predict which word is more likely to appear next in the sentence. Hence it is widely used in predictive text input systems, speech recognition, machine translation, spelling correction etc. The input to a language model is usually a training set of example sentences. The output is a probability distribution over sequences of words. We can use the last one word (unigram), last two words (bigram), last three words (trigram) or last n words (n-gram) to predict the next word as per our requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-complete system is something you may see every day.\n",
    "- When you google something, you often have suggestions to help you complete your search. \n",
    "- When you are writing an email, you get suggestions telling you possible endings to your sentence.  \n",

    "### Creating Unigram, Bigram and Trigram Language Models\n",
    "We can create n-grams using the ngrams module from nltk.util. N-grams are a sequence of n consecutive words occurring in the corpus. For example, the sentence ‚ÄúI love dogs‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄòI‚Äô, ‚Äòlove‚Äô and ‚Äòdogs‚Äô are unigrams while ‚ÄòI love‚Äô and ‚Äòlove dogs‚Äô are bigrams. ‚ÄòI love dogs‚Äô is itself a trigram i.e. a contiguous sequence of three words. We obtain unigrams, bigrams and trigrams from the corpus using the following code :"
