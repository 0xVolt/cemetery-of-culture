## TODO - Experiment 1.a

---

### Preliminary

- [ ] Finish documentation
- [ ] Refactor variables
- [ ] Clean up importing libraries
- [ ] Create a better log file
- [ ] Look into a better way of generating a better coefficient set
- [ ] Pretty up the time domain plot *(she doesn't really know what she wants)*
- [ ] Add more insight into the bode graphs
  - [ ] Explain the control electronics
  - [ ] Talk about domains of analysis
  - [ ] Transfer functions and the coefficient set

### Bonus

- [ ] Control electronics in F1
- [ ] Bode graphs of F1 data as a project case study or intelligent systems
  - [ ] Telemetry as an intelligent study
