Exceptions:

  * Handling is done by execpt: cluase and code is done by try: cluase

  * When using another library, when exceptions arent written, a problem may go unsolved and wont be able to be user friendly

  * Good practice to use when using other libraries

  * Lots of in-built exceptions
    Exception --> parent exception, all are derived from this one
    All the exceptions follow a hierarchy

  * These exceptions are raised whenever there is a    block in code that may cause a termination -> when user passes data -> division -> etc.

  * When exceptions aren't handled, stack unwinding will take place to identify which function was called last to identify which function the error came from

  * Exception handling is when you catch the exception
    Multiple exceptions may be handled at once


Serialization:

  * When you download data from twitter, the data downloads as .json files

  * Python uses pickled files

  * Whenever we want to save data variables, we use serialization

  * It converts objects -> almost everything in py, lists, dicts, ints, floats, are all objects -> to something you can transfer from computer to computer

  * dump & load
    * dump() -> convert object to something to transfer, we dump the objects into a file

    * get original data from serialized file, we use load()

  * serialize dict to file 'f' -> we dump() f to transfer and then we load() f to get back the dict

  * .json format resembles python dictionaries -> nothing but key-value pairs

  * companies often have propriatary serialization techniques since if you know how the data has been serialized, you can figure out what the data is

  * but pickle is a format provided by python -> used in legacy code -> security issues -> good for personal use
    
    * AS PER PY DOC => pickle files can be hacked -> raw pickle files over the network cannot be trusted -> can run arbitrary py scripts when loaded -> can be injected with malicious code
    
    * Your own pickle writing and reading is absolutely safe -> DONT USE PICKLE TO TRANSFER DATA VARIABLES
