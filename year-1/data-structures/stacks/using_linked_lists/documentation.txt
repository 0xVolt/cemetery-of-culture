The most importatn property of a stack is LIFO

This occurs because there is only one position of insertion and deletion
in the stack. We keep track of this position using top

i.e. element that was inserted last gets deleted first --> LIFO

With respect to linked-lists
    We use only two functions 
        insertBeg() --> push() &
        deleteBeg() --> pop()
    Top becomes Head --> variable that points to the last inserted element
    We can use a temp to traverse
